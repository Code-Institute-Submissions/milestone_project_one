# Milestone Project One

Project hosted at: [Emily Claire Photography](https://johnl3.github.io/milestone_project_one/index.html)  

A web site for those looking for the services of a photographer. Using a simple reactive layout that
can be viewed on both small and large screens.  

## UX

This website is for anybody looking for a photographer.  

As a user I should be able to visit a page containing the name of the website.  
As a user I should be able to navigate to all the other pages from the landing page.  
As a user I should be able to vist an about page which details what the photographer dose.
As a user I should be able to navigate to all other pages from the about page.  
As a user I should be able to navigate to a gallery page to see some examples of the photographers work.  
As a user I should be able to navigate to all other pages from the gallery page.
As a user I should be able to navigate to a contact page to find photographers contact details and fill in a
form if I require further information.  
As a user I should be able to navigate to all other pages from the contact page.
As a user I should be able to navigate to a tips page to see some photography tips.  
As a user I should be able to navigate to all other pages from the tips page.

## Features

On large screen desktop size there is a sidepanel on all pages which contains the navigation, which allows users to 
navigate through the website.  
On the gallery page there are images allowing users to see what kind of work the photographer has done.  
On the contact page there is a form which to fill in if users decides he requires more information.  
On the tips page there is a video so users can learn some photo tips to help them when they take their own
photos.  

On medium size screens there is a horizontal navigation header.

On small screens there is a dropdown navigation.

### Future Features

As this project had to be done in html and css it would be nice to change the dropdown menu which was
done using only css, to use javascript as I feel it would work better.
